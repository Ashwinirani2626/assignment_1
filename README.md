redbus project
Upon receiving project first I started coading for redbus project which was taught in class. Next step was to do web scrapping in this process I learnt how to do web scrapping. While doing this project I came across Operational errors which I solved after discussion . After this I pushed database through SQL . Next step was to do query through Streamlit and finally I uploaded files through github.
